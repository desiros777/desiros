/**

 * Low level API to manage multiple MMU translation tables. The API
 * (not its implementation) should be some kind of
 * architecture-independent.
 *
 * The goal of this API is:
 *   - To provide a simple arch-independent API to change the current
 *     address space configured in the MMU
 *   - To make sure that ALL the kernel space mappings are always kept
 *     IDENTICAL among all the address spaces in the whole system. That
 *     way, a virtual address in the kernel space refers to EXACTLY the
 *     same physical memory location for all the address spaces.
